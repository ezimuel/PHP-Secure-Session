Encrypt PHP session data using files
----------------------------------------------
The encryption is built using mcrypt extension 
and the randomness is managed by openssl (falling
back to mcrypt if openssl is unavailable).

The default encryption algorithm is Rijndael-128
and we use CBC+HMAC (Encrypt-then-mac)

How to use it
-------------
Include the SecureSession.php in your project and use
the PHP session as usual.

Demo
----
In the demo folder you can see a simple PHP script (demo.php)
that stores some data in $_SESSION and display the encrypted
data of the session file (stored in /tmp).

Release Note:
-------------
06 June    2012 - Added the demo script
16 October 2011 - Added the CBC+HMAC authentication
